# The following is info on the current user's mail box. Unless an abnormal
# condition exists, this is expected to say "no mail" because mail should be
# delivered to individual users by outgoing email forwarding. This info is
# supposed to be basically the same thing that sshd already provides, but I
# wanted this to be on the same line as the MTA mail queue info above to save
# screen space.
# If the MTA queue info above is disabled, then this should probably be
# disabled, too, in favour of the appropriate option "pam_mail.so standard"
# in /etc/pam.d/sshd. (NB. By default that option seems to be set on Cat, but
# it might be overridden elsewhere. The default config says "noenv" = not to
# set $MAIL, but it is set. The "nopen" option should disable printing the mail
# box info, but set $MAIL. Or comment the entire line and be done with it.)

# x means 'quit without saving'. mail will return an error code if there is no
# mail. That error code is all we're interested in.
# :TODO: check out `mail -e`
