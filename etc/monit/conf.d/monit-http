# Monit has an embedded HTTP interface which can be used to view status of
# services monitored and manage services from a web interface. The HTTP
# interface is also required if you want to issue Monit commands from the
# command line, such as 'monit status' or 'monit restart service' The reason
# for this is that the Monit client uses the HTTP interface to send these
# commands to a running Monit daemon.

set httpd port 2812 and
    use address localhost  # only accept connection from localhost
    allow localhost        # allow localhost to connect to the server and

    allow @monit           # allow users of group 'monit' to connect (rw)
