# virtual hosting default config file


# This config file is supposed to catch requests not caught by any other virtual
# host configuration, including requests with an HTTP/1.1 Host header containing
# this server's IP address. For both purposes the IP address must always be kept
# current in the ServerName. Including the IP address in the VirtualHost
# directive itself is not recommended. Note that the _default_ address in the
# VirtualHost directive does not have any effect in this configuration (solely
# name-based virtual hosting).

# This is the default virtual host on Clyde.
