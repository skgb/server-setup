Reciprocal Backup Arrangement


The hosts

    solent.skgb.de

and

    galway.johannessen.de

copy their encrypted backups to each other. Caveats:

- Both hosts are located at the same ISP (albeit with different
  product lines). When considering redundancy, this arrangement is far
  from ideal; however, it also makes configuration significantly
  easier. Additionally, it is believed that severe data losses are
  sufficiently rare that this arrangement offers enough safety for us
  for the time being.

- The encryption is to specific PGP keys. Decryption requires having
  both the private key and its passphrase at hand. The passphrase is
  currently not stored on the servers itself.

- The encryption is partial only: Databases and confidential server
  config files (such as passwords and SSL keys) are encrypted, regular
  data files (such as those available on the SKGB-intern service) are
  not.

- The encryption may or may not be evident from the backup file name.
  This is dependant upon the details of the backup export script,
  which is subject to change.


Responsible Person for this arrangement is:
